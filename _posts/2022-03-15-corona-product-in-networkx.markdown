Hi, I just want to announce that my contribution will be released in networkX 3.0, which adds corona product. NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

If your want to learn more about this product, see the [Corona Product](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) blog post.

Hi, I just want to announce that my contribution will be released in networkX 3.0, which adds corona product. [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx) is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

If your want to learn more about this product, see the [Corona Product](https://blog.alifaraji.ir/math/graph-theory/corona-product.html) blog post.

My pull request: [Pull Request](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/pull/5223)

thank you,
Ali Faraji

Hi,

My name is [Ali Faraji](https://faraji.info/).

I am a Machine Learning enthusiastic and an open-source fan. I am into Mathematics.

## Goal for 2024

Keep the damn vscode open and keep coding along with reading papers.

## Day to Day Work

I am currently hacking on (as of Nov 2024):

- Machine Learning & Unlearning
- Spatiotemporal Data
- Stuff Related to LLMs & Transformers

## Skills

My skills include but not limited to Python, Pytorch, Data Visualization, Statistics & Probability, Java EE, Spring, RDBMS, Angular, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Networking, Arduino, Server Configuration, Linux, Docker, AWS, API Development, Git,CI/CD, aspect oriented programming, object oriented programming, eclipse IDEs, wordpress plugin development, LLM-based application development.

Yes, those are a lot of skills ü§Ø, but I am not a master of all of them. I am a master of none üòè, but I am a jack of all trades. I am a fast learner and I am always eager to learn new things by jumping into documentation/code and finding out what is behind it. :))

## Open Source

I love open-source. I have contributed to some open-source projects. I have also developed some open-source projects. Always looking for new/old open-source projects to contribute to. specially in the field of Machine Learning or scientific programming.

## Sports

I love gym, swimming, and cycling.
